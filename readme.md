# Zack's Pose Game
**By: Zack Beucler**
**AT101 Final Project**

### Goal
The goal for this project was to make a game that integrated machine learning, computer vision, and physical activity. Therefore, I came up with **Zack's Pose Game!** The game consists of 4 poses (arms at your side, left arm up, right arm up, and both arms up.) The game will randomly select one of the four poses, and display that pose on the screen. The player then has to get into that pose before the alloted time runs out to score a point.

### Note
To start the game, open the folder in your terminal. Then enter `python3 -m http.server` to start a server (usually at `localhost:8000`). This is required or else the game will not work.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, I really really enjoyed this project. Machine learning has been something that I have been extremely interested oin, but also intimidated by. By being able to use Teachable Machine, I was able to use ML in a high-level, which removed a lot of the intimidation for me. Something I wanted to do was to add more poses to the model. However, everytime I added more poses, the accuracy of the model in general would go way down. The aspect I struggled with the most with this project was making it look good. I was really happy with the functionality but I had a real hard time with the aesthetics. I don't think of myself as a creative person so I've always had a hard time making my projects visually appealing. In the future, I want to add more poses and improve the UI/UX.
